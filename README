A ROS based extrinsic calibration tool for a monocular camera to a 2D laser.
Subscribe to /camera/rgb/image_color and /scan.
The topic /scan should contain the laser scans and /camera/rgb/image_color should contain the corresponding checkerborad images.
line.cpp extracts laser points dropping on the calibration plane using RANSAC.
pose.cpp uses opencv to find the checkerboard pose.
