Development of an extrinsic calibration package of a monocular camera to a 2D laser.
Uses a rosbag file to subscribe to /camera/rgb/image_color and /scan.
The bag contains laser scan and and corresponding checkerborad images.
line.cpp extracts laser points on the calibration plane using RANSAC.
pose.cpp uses opencv to find the checkerboard pose.
transform.cpp uses the above to find an optimal transform between the camera and the laser.
