The package only extracts data in the format required by RADLOCC package to
calibrate a camera to a laser scanner. 

Uncomment the other executables for the calibration code.

Development of an extrinsic calibration package of a monocular camera to a 2D laser.
Subscribe to /camera/rgb/image_color and /scan.
The topic /scan should contain the laser scans and /camera/rgb/image_color should contain the corresponding checkerborad images.
line.cpp extracts laser points dropping on the calibration plane using RANSAC.
pose.cpp uses opencv to find the checkerboard pose.
Set the macro WRITE to 1 in order to save the data required by the RADLOCC package.
data.txt will have the laser data and val.txt will have the timestamps of the checker board images.
