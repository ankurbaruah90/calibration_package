A ROS based extrinsic calibration tool for a monocular camera to a 2D laser.

The package uses a checker board to estimate the equation of the checker board 
plane in camera frame. From the available information on the location of the 
checker board w.r.t. laser, it estimates the laser points falling on the checker 
board. These points are transformed to camera frame for further processing.

Using a search optimization it makes a random estimate of the transformation of 
camera w.r.t. laser. If the generated transformation estimate if optimal, then 
the laser points on the checker board in the camera frame should satisfy the 
plane equation.

The search optimization iteratively generates transformation estimates until a 
solution is found. It currently uses PSO, the code to which can be found in the 
repository https://github.com/ankurbaruah90/pso.

Process Flow:
1. pso.cpp generates random solutions and publishes them to transform.cpp
2. transform.cpp subscribes to line.cpp and pose.cpp for estimates of checker
   board plane equation and laser points in the checker board.
3. transform.cpp returns a score based on the degree to which the laser points 
   satisfy the plane equation.
4. pso.cpp repeats this process until the spread of the swarm of particles 
   fall within a set threshold and results the optimal transform between the 
   camera and the laser.
